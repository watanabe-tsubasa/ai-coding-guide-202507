## Project Overview

This project, "AI Coding Guide," is a collection of educational materials designed to teach users how to effectively use AI assistants for pair programming. It consists of a series of guided projects, each with increasing complexity, covering topics from basic setup to algorithms, database applications, UI development, and more. The goal is to help users understand the strengths and weaknesses of AI in coding tasks and to develop best practices for providing instructions and feedback.

The project is structured as a series of guides and corresponding example implementations. The `guides` directory contains Markdown files with detailed instructions for each project, while the (now deleted) `examples` directory is intended to hold the code generated by the AI based on those guides.

This is a **Code Project** based on Node.js and TypeScript, but it's unique in that it's a meta-project for learning, rather than a single application.

## Building and Running

The project itself doesn't have a single build or run command, as it's a collection of smaller projects. However, the `guides/00-setup.md` file provides a clear set of commands for setting up and running the individual projects. Here's a summary of the key commands for a typical sub-project:

*   **Installation:**
    ```bash
    npm install typescript vitest @types/node --save-dev
    ```

*   **Testing:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

*   **Running:**
    The `guides/00-setup.md` file details several ways to run TypeScript files, with `tsx` being the recommended modern approach for development:
    ```bash
    npx tsx src/index.ts
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Testing Framework:** Vitest
*   **Module System:** ES Modules (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`)
*   **Directory Structure:** Source code is expected to be in a `src` directory within each sub-project folder (e.g., `examples/00-setup/src`).
*   **Development Process:** The guides emphasize a test-driven development (TDD) approach, where tests are written before or alongside the implementation.
*   **AI Interaction:** The project's core convention is to provide clear, specific, and step-by-step instructions to the AI assistant. The guides themselves are examples of this convention.
